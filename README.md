# Capstone

# Summary
  I started off this project with the goal of classifying cars by make, based on a pre-configured dataset from Stanford University's AI website: (https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html). I made use of TensorFlow's Image Data Generator to transform the images into matrices of pixel data, created a convolutional neural network to classify unseen validation images to different makes of car. I was able to utilize pre-trained models like EfficientNetB3 that were trained on the 'Imagenet' dataset to achieve an accuracy score of ~83% on testing data with 196 total classes.


Because the data files were too large to host on github, I have uploaded them to google drive and they are accessible here:
